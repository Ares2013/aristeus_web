						to Friday. This decentralized structure allows traders to buy and sell currencies without extra
						fees and commissions. It also provides access to trading anytime and from anywhere in the

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								<strong style='color:#333;'>High liquidity and best prices.</strong> In Forex there are
								always
								traders who are willing to buy or sell. The market never sleeps. An ECN Broker offers
								its
								clients the best quotes from major banks, other ECNs and liquidity providers. The Broker
								actually profits from providing the best quotes and the tightest spreads.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<strong style='color:#333;'>You can trade with as little as $100!</strong> Starting deposits in Forex are considerably lower
								than in other financial markets. Leveraged (or marginal) trading used in Forex lets you
								operate funds many times as large as your margin deposit
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<strong style='color:#333;'>In Forex, there is always a chance to earn. </strong>Stock markets
									can crash and securities may lose their value but when one currency is depreciating,
									the other will be gaining value and you can earn on that as well.

							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<strong style='color:#333;'>Market Analytics are easy to follow. </strong>There are only 4 major currency pairs in Forex. You can
								choose just one currency pair or several pairs to focus on. Monitoring news and market analytics
								for 4 currency pairs is easier than struggling to keep an eye on thousands of stocks.

							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<strong style='color:#333;'>Education and Training for Beginners </strong>You broker provides you with demo-accounts, training
								courses and workshops, video tutorials, news, charts and market analytics so that you can
								practice your trading skills.

							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<strong style='color:#333;'>Access to trading 24/5 from anywhere . </strong>The market trades 24 hours a day, 5 days a week from
								Monday to Friday, and your broker offers you support 24 hours a day. You can choose when to
								trade – the European, US and the Asian trading sessions follow each other. When trading sessions
								in different time zones overlap, the available liquidity in Forex reaches its maximum.

					<p>Forex is always traded in currency pairs, for example EUR/USD. The first currency (EUR) is called
						the ‘base currency’. The second currency (USD) is known as the ‘counter currency’. The way
						currencies are displayed shows us how many units of the counter currency you can buy with one
						unit of the base currency. This is the exchange rate, or in other words, how many US dollars you
						can buy for one euro.</p>
