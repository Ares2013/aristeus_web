				RISK WARNING
			</div>
			<div class='txt'>
				CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage.Â You
				should consider whether you understand how CFDs work and whether you can afford to take the high risk of
				losing your money.

			<div class='subTitle'>
				HIGH RISK WARNING
			</div>
			<div class='txt'>
				Foreign exchange trading carries a high level of risk that may not be suitable for all investors.
				Leverage creates additional risk and loss exposure. Before you decide to trade foreign exchange,
				carefully consider your investment objectives, experience level, and risk tolerance. You could lose some
				or all of your initial investment; do not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. Educate yourself
				on the risks associated with foreign exchange trading and seek advice from an independent financial or
				tax advisor if you have any questions.

					<p class='s_title'>1.INVESTING</p>
					<div class='s_txt'>
						<p>
							We have set out below a summary of the nature and risks associated with the types of
							investments that the Client may trade when operating a brokerage account with a forex or CFD
							broker. This information is not intended to constitute a comprehensive statement of all the
							risks to which investors might be exposed and there may be others that exist now or which
							may arise in the future.The main general risks associated with investing are as follows:
						</p>
						<p>
							(1) Past performance is not an indicator of future performance;
						</p>
						<p>
							(2) The value of investments may go down as well as up;
						</p>
						<p>
							(3) You are not certain to make a profit. You may make a loss. You may lose your entire
							investment;
						</p>
						<p>
							(4) The price or value of investments may fluctuate significantly;
						</p>
						<p>
							(5) If there are income distributions, they may also fluctuate significantly.
						</p>
						<p>
							(6) The investments described below are complex and derivative financial instruments. We are
							therefore required to make you aware of how they differ from non-complex financial
							instruments, such as unit trusts or shares, and the risks that they pose to investors.
						</p>

					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='s_title'>2.CONTRACTS FOR DIFFERENCES</p>
					<div class='s_txt'>
						<p>
							Contracts For Differences (CFDs) are financial instruments that allow you to speculate on
							price movements in underlying markets. CFDs can be compared to futures which can be entered
							into in relation to foreign exchange or the FTSE-100 index or any other index or share. CFDs
							must however be settled in cash. The risk profile of CFDs is similar to futures or options.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although the prices at which you bet are set by us, our prices are derived from the
							underlying market. Fluctuations in the price of the underlying market will therefore effect
							the profitability of your trade. Some such risks include:
						</p>
						<p style='padding-top:5px;font-weight:bold;'>
							(1) Currency
						</p>
						<p>
							If you trade in a market other than your base currency market, currency exchange
							fluctuations will impact your profits and losses;
						</p>
						<p style='padding-top:5px;font-weight:bold;'>
							(2) Volatility
						</p>
						<p>
							Movements in the price of underlying markets can be volatile and unpredictable. This will
							have a direct impact on your profits and losses. Knowing the volatility of an underlying
							market will help guide you as to where any stops should be placed.
						</p>
						<p style='padding-top:5px;font-weight:bold;'>
							(3) Gapping
						</p>
						<p>
							"Gapping" is a sudden shift in the price of an underlying from one level to another. Various
							factors can lead to gapping (for example, economic events or market announcements) and
							gapping can occur both when the underlying market is open and when it is closed. When these
							factors occur when the underlying market is closed, the price of the underlying market when
							it reopens (and therefore our derived price) can be markedly different from the closing
							price, with no opportunity to close your trade in-between. "Gapping" can result in a
							significant loss (or profit). A non-guaranteed stop will not protect you against this risk
							whereas a guaranteed stop will protect you against the market gapping.
						</p>
						<p style='padding-top:5px;font-weight:bold;'>
							(4) Market liquidity
						</p>
						<p>
							Market conditions can change significantly in a very short period of time, so that if you
							wish to close a contract we might not be able to do so under the same terms as when you
							opened it.
						</p>
						<p style='padding-top:10px;'>
							When trading, profits or losses can be incurred at high speed therefore it is important that
							you monitor your positions closely. It is your responsibility to monitor your CFDs and while
							you have open trades you should always be in a position to do so.
						</p>
						<p style='padding-top:10px;'>
							When a non-guaranteed stop is triggered it has the effect of issuing an order by you to
							close your bet. It is therefore not closed immediately when the stop is triggered. We aim to
							deal with such orders fairly and promptly but the time taken to fill the order and level at
							which the order is filled depends upon the underlying market. In fast-moving markets a price
							for the level of your order might not be available, or the market might move quickly and
							significantly away from the stop level before we fill it.
						</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='s_title'>3.OPTIONS</p>
					<div class='s_txt'>
						<p>
							There are many different types of options with different characteristics subject to the
							following conditions:
						</p>
						<p>
							Buying options involves less risk than selling options because, if the price of the
							underlying asset moves against you, you can simply allow the option to lapse. This would
							mean, however, losing the entire option investment. The maximum loss is limited to the
							premium, plus any commission or other transaction charges. However, if you buy a call option
							on a futures contract and you later exercise the option, you will acquire the future.
						</p>
						<p>
							Certain options markets operate on a margined basis, under which buyers do not pay the full
							premium on their option at the time they purchase it. In this situation you may subsequently
							be called upon to pay margin on the option up to the level of your premium. If you fail to
							do so as required, your position may be closed or liquidated in the same way as a futures
							position.

						</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='s_title'>4.ROLLING SPOT FOREX</p>
					<div class='s_txt'>
						<p>
							Forex and currency options carry similar risks as investing in a future. Transactions in
							rolling forex or currency options may also have the added risks of fluctuations in foreign
							exchange rates and political or economic policy changes in foreign markets. Margined
							currency trading may also have contingent liability and is one of the riskiest forms of
							investment. Rolling spot forex is therefore only suitable for sophisticated individuals. The
							risk of losing the entire investment means that speculation in the foreign exchange market
							should be conducted with risk capital funds that if lost will not affect your personal
							financial wellbeing.
						</p>

					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='s_title'>5.FUTURES</p>
					<div class='s_txt'>
						<p>
							Transactions in futures involve the obligation to make, or to take, delivery of the
							underlying asset of the contract at a future date, or in some cases to settle the position
							with cash. They carry a high degree of risk. The "gearing" or "leverage" often obtainable in
							futures trading means that a small deposit or down payment can lead to large losses as well
							as gains. It also means that a relatively small movement can lead to a proportionately much
							larger movement in the value of your investment and can work against you as well as for you.
							Futures transactions have a contingent liability, and you should be aware of the
							implications of this, in particular the margining requirements.
						</p>

					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='s_title'>6.CONTINGENT LIABILITY TRANSACTIONS</p>
					<div class='s_txt'>
						<p>
							Contingent liability transactions (CLTs) are transactions which are margined and may require
							you to make a series of payments against the purchase price of an investment rather than
							paying the whole purchase price up front. There is a risk that this margin may be lost or
							that additional margin may be required if the market moves against you. Failure to do so
							could result in liquidation of the investment at a loss. In the event an investment is not
							margined, there may still be contingent requirements to make payment in certain
							circumstances.
						</p>

					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='s_title'>7.INVESTMENTS DENOMINATED IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE BASE CURRENCY OF YOUR
						ACCOUNT</p>
					<div class='s_txt'>
						<p>
							We may effect transactions on your behalf in an investment denominated in a currency other
							than the agreed base currency of your Account (which is the currency in which your Trading
							Account is valued).
						</p>
						<p>
							A movement in exchange rates may have a separate effect, favourable as well as unfavourable,
							on the gain or loss otherwise experienced on the investment concerned. In addition, if you
							deposit collateral denominated in one currency, you may be subject to margin calls in
							circumstances where the obligations secured by such collateral are denominated in another
							currency (in addition to the risk of margin calls for fluctuations in relative values). Some
							currencies are not freely convertible and restrictions may be placed on the conversion
							and/or repatriation of your funds including any profits or dividends.
						</p>
